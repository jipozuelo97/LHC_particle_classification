# LHC_particle_classification
Exploration of machine learning algorithms applied to the categorization of proton collisions in particle accelerators.

# DESCRIPTION
Machine learning is a form of problem solving that is gaining more and more ground in every conceivable field, from song recommendations to landing rockets on Mars. It is therefore not surprising that solutions are beginning to be sought to facilitate scientific research using machine learning models, deep learning, neural networks...

One of the fields in which this type of technique is being applied is particle physics, more specifically in particle accelerators such as the one located at CERN, Geneva.

A particle accelerator is a device that uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged particles to high speeds, and thus make them collide with other particles. Specifically, in the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), beams of protons collide at a rate of 1 billion collisions per second. In the places where these collisions occur, detectors are placed that use electronic hardware to select potentially interesting proton collisions for further analysis.
These detectors, which constitute a distributed system, use software that chooses whether or not to select a collision in the required time, which is a mere microsecond.

What has been explained above works well so far, but with the new technologies available and the need to go deeper into the subatomic world, new approaches must be considered to obtain better results.

The main reason why new solutions have to be considered is because in 2027 the LHC will upgrade its current state (one billion proton-proton collisions per second) in such a way that it will increase the number of collisions per second by a factor of 5 to 7, ultimately resulting in a total amount of accumulated data an order of magnitude higher than what is possible with the current collider.
Due to this increase in collisions coupled with the high number of tasks being performed and the limited number of processors, machine learning solutions have to be explored to minimize latency and maximize the accuracy of the tasks to be performed.
